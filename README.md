# Data Science Skin Cancer detection using Convolution Neural Networks  based model: Project Overview
---
* I have used a pre trained model using Transfer-learning and all the model building is based on custom model
* 

## Code and Resources Used
---
* **Python Version:** 3.7
* **Packages:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, pathlib, tensorflow, PIL, os, tensorflow.keras

## Loading Data
* dataset consists of about **2357 images of skin cancer types,** The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
* Load using **Keras.preprocessing**
* update the path of the train and test datasets
* Visualising 9 different cancers 1 from each class
